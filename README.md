## ABAP setup

To run an ABAP program you will have to get hold of an SAP system. You can get a trial account from the
SAP website.

Setting up SAP seems to be quite hard. It will test your determination and make you ask yourself whether
you want to learn ABAP and SAP after all. If you complete this step, you may consider yourself initiated
into the SAP programmer club.
